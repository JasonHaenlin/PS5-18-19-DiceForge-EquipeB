## <span style="color:darkcyan">Simple rules to follow (dev team)</span>

### Before coding
- cmd : `git pull`
- Check the task on *github project*
- Move a task in *In progress* and assign it to you

### While coding
- You have to test everytime you have a new piece of code, especially if is a sensitive part
- Think about the comments in the code and in the tests, so that other members will understand more easily.

### After coding
- cmd : `mvn test` <strong style="color:brown">! not IntelliJ</strong>
- cmd : `git add *` 
- cmd : `git commit -m "#<task id> <write a message>"`
- cmd : `git push`
- If the task is done put it in *Done* and put also the *Feature* in *Delivered feature* if you are done with it

### Advance feature
- You are encouraged to check the CI result, especially the quality gate

### Special care
- Be careful with the naming policy in Java
- Don't write any Frenglish please (only English)
- Don't forget the **#\<task id\>** on each commit
- Ask the other team members if you don't understand or if you are not sure about something
